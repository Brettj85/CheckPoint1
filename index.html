            Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!

            The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
            
            Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well.
            
            Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor!
            
            Da Eitha! Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota... Boscka! I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee. Oh, no! Chewbacca! At last we have the mighty Chewbacca. Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand. I want fifty thousand. No less. Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. Because he's holding a thermal detonator. This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive. Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it. Zeebuss. He agrees! Just relax for a moment.

The Rancor!
                
                Da Eitha! Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota... Boscka! I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee. Oh, no! Chewbacca! At last we have the mighty Chewbacca. Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand. I want fifty thousand. No less. Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. Because he's holding a thermal detonator. This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive. Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it. Zeebuss. He agrees! Just relax for a moment.

                Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!
    
                The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
                
                Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well.
                
                Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor!

I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well.
    
    Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor!
    
    Da Eitha! Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota... Boscka! I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee. Oh, no! Chewbacca! At last we have the mighty Chewbacca. Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand. I want fifty thousand. No less. Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. Because he's holding a thermal detonator. This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive. Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it. Zeebuss. He agrees! Just relax for a moment.

                Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!
    
    The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
